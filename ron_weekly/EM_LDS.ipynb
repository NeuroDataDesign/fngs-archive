    "# Expectation maximization for Linear Dynamical System Identification\n",

    "In this notebook, we will present a high level overall summary of the paper [An M-Estimator for Reduced-Rank High-Dimensional Linear Dynamical System Identification](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.03927v1.pdf), as well as a univariate implementation of the algorithm in Python.\n",

    "## High level summary of solution\n",
    " - Generalization of the classical Kalman Filter-Smoother Expectation-Maximization algorithm\n",
    " - Want to fit statistical model to time series data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    " - abundance of high dimensional time series data, we want to fit statistical models to them\n",
    " - Existing methods cannot cope with high dimensional nature of these problems because of computational and statistical reasons\n",
    " - Parameters for Kalman filters are often unknown - opportunity to use unsupervised learning\n",
    " - 3 main issues: dense high dimensional matrices, estimators are numerically unstable, computation time\n",
